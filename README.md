# PlotStuff
Generates (not so) beautiful plots. They get either written into a file or display in a window.

# Dependencies
To display the plot in a window you need a running X-Server, nothing more! To write the image to a file you need no dependencies!

# Dev Dependencies
 * CMake
 * gcc
 * libx11-dev
 * a posix compliant OS
